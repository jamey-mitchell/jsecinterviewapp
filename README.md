# My JSEC Interview App

### This app was written for a job interview. I took [a pluralsight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-practical-start) to get started learning, and while this app doesn't match exactly what he builds in the course, it built similarly and with comments throughout.

#### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
#### In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
- Runs the app in the development mode.\
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- The page will reload when you make changes.\
- You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
- It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
- Your app is ready to be deployed!
